```js
const automately = new (require('automately'))({
  // Not required, but having one removes limits (get your key at https://itwcreativeworks.com).
  apiKey: 'api_test_key'
});
```

  var automately = new AutoMately({
    // Not required, but having one removes limits (get your key at https://itwcreativeworks.com).
    apiKey: 'api_test_Key'
  });
</script>
```
